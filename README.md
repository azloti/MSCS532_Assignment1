This is a repo for Assignment 1: Setting Up Python Environment, Visual Studio Code and Creation of GitHub Account

I already had the python environment + VS Code environment set up, so I just created a new Github account using my university email. 

I struggled a bit with adding my secondary account ssh key, but after setting my old public key in my new account everything seems to be working correctly.

This repo implements a monotonically decreasing insertion sort in python. It generates a random array of numbers for easier testing, and appears to be working correctly.
